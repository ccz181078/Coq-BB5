# Deciders

Deciders are algorithm that decide whether a given Turing machine halts or not from all-0 tape.

The deciders used in the proof are all implemented in this folder (see `../README.md`) and are presented in great detail in [bbchallenge's BB5 paper](https://github.com/bbchallenge/bbchallenge-paper).

Each decider is documented with internal comments.

We list here the information about each of them that was originally provided with the proof.

## Common notions

A Turing machine (TM) has type $St\to\Sigma\to ((St\times\{-1,+1\}\times\Sigma)+\{\bot\})$, given current state and input, it returns the next state, head moving direction and output; $\bot$ means halt at the next step.

An `ExecState` has type $St\times (\mathbb{Z}\to\Sigma)$, it encodes the state and tape content after some steps.


## `Decider_Loop.v`

This is a trivial decider for one of these situations:

1. The TM halts after some steps.
2. The TM reaches an `ExecState` $0^\infty A(s,x)B0^\infty$ twice.
3. The TM reaches an `ExecState` $0^\infty CBA(s,x)0^\infty$ , and $\forall C,\;0^\infty CBA(s,x)0^\infty \rightsquigarrow^+ 0^\infty CB^2A(s,x)0^\infty$.

Here we write an `ExecState` as a string, $0^\infty A(s,x)B0^\infty$ meaning current state is $s$ , current input is $x$ , the half-tape to the left(right) of the head is $0^\infty A$ ( $B0^\infty$ ), $A,B,C\dots$ are strings and $x,a,b,c\dots$ are elements of $\Sigma$.

$X\rightsquigarrow^+Y$ means $Y$ is reachable from $X$ after some steps (but not 0 step).

`loop1_decider` is the implementation of this method. It simulate the TM execution for $2^k$ steps, and checks whether the (state,input) history has a suffix that repeats at least twice and is case 2 or case 3.

## `Decider_Halt.v` and `Verifier_Halt.v`

`halt_decider` is a weaker version, only checks for case 1 above (halts), and saves a lot of memory because the history `ExecState` are no longer useful.

`halt_verifier` is similar to `halt_decider`, but verify whether the number of steps before halting is the desired value. The lower bound of BB(5) is proved by this verifier.

## `Decider_NGramCPS.v`

The idea of this decider is simple:

If we have finite sets $L,R\in\mathcal{P}(\Sigma^n)$ and $M\in\mathcal{P}(St\times \Sigma^{2n+1})$ , and forall reachable `ExecState` $0^\infty A(s,x)B0^\infty$ , $(s,A[-n:]xB[:n])\in M$ and $\forall m\in\mathrm{N}^+,\;(0^\infty) A[-m-n:-m]\in L,\;(B0^\infty) [m:m+n]\in R$ (":" is in numpy style), then the TM will never halt.

See [Nathan-Fenner/bb-simple-n-gram-cps (github.com)](https://github.com/Nathan-Fenner/bb-simple-n-gram-cps) for more details.

We can record more information on the tape, for example, use a queue of fixed size or a LRU cache to save the update history of each position on the tape.  This is implemented by increasing the size of the charset $\Sigma$ without affect to the TM's haltness. The NGramCPS decider is improved a lot by this way.

`NGramCPS_decider_impl1` use a fixed size queue for update history (i.e. record the last k updates where k is a constant).

`NGramCPS_decider_impl2` doesn't use update history (and it's faster).

`NGramCPS_LRU_decider` use an LRU cache (i.e. maintain a list of $St\times Î£$ , and for each update $(s,i)$ (current (state,input)) , remove it from the list and push it to the front of the list) for update history.

We use `PositiveMap.tree` (and sometimes together with a list) as the data structure of a finite set/map. `PositiveMap.tree` needs `positive` (bit-string) keys, so some functions named `..._enc` are used to encode elements of other type as bit-string.

## `Decider_RepWL.v`

This decider is the special case of CTL deciders ([The 30 to 34 CTL holdouts from BB(5) - Individual machines - The Busy Beaver Challenge (bbchallenge.org)](https://discuss.bbchallenge.org/t/the-30-to-34-ctl-holdouts-from-bb-5/141)).

If we have finite sets $S_1,S_2$ of $\mathrm{RegExp}\times St\times \mathrm{RegExp}$ , and forall reachable `ExecState`, it can reach an `ExecState` $0^\infty A(s,x)B0^\infty$ , exists $R_1,R_2\in\mathrm{RegExp}$ , $R_1,R_2$ matches $A,xB$ (or $Ax,B$) and $(R_1,s,R_2)\in S_1$ (or $(R_1,s,R_2)\in S_2$ ), then the TM will never halt. $S_1$ and $S_2$ are needed because of the two directions of the TM's directed head: i.e. in $S_1$ the head points to $R_2$ and in $S_2$ it points to $R_1$.

Regular expressions used in this decider (with parameters $n$ and $m$) are limited to be like $A_1A_2A_3\dots A_{n_0}$ and each $A_i$ is like $B^k$ or $B^mB^*$ , $B$ matches a fixed string of length $n$ , and $1\le k\le m-1$ .

For example, when n=2, m=3, the tape will be divide into blocks of length n, and erase the information of more than m repeats, like `...00000101010111 <A 10101111110000...` =>  `...00 00 01 01 01 01 11 <A 10 10 11 11 11 00 00...` => `(01)^3+ (11)^1 <A (10)^2 (11)^3+`  , here `01^3+`  matches `01^3, 01^4, 01^5, ...`  and `11 <A 10` (directed head notation) means `1(A,1)10` .

For an abstracted `ExecState` represented as $\mathrm{RegExp}\times St\times \mathrm{RegExp}$ , we can run it for a macro-step (until the head leave current block (or timeout)). The decider will extend $S_1,S_2$ in this way until they are closed under macro-step (or timeout). The two regular expressions in an abstracted `ExecState` can be viewed as two stacks, a macro-step pops a block from a stack, and then push the updated block into a stack. Pop is like `(01)^3+ => (01,(01)^3+),(01,(01)^2);  (01)^2 => (01,(01)^1);  (01)^1 => (01,) ` , push is the reversed procedure of pop.

## `Decider_FAR.v`

This decider accepts a DFA as input, and constructs an NFA (the method is described in [Direct recognizer for L(TM/~) ](https://github.com/bbchallenge/bbchallenge-deciders/tree/main/decider-finite-automata-reduction)) to recognize all tape configuration that will halt. The decider then check whether initial tape configuration is accepted, if not, the TM will never halt.

The decider part, i.e. searching of the DFA, is not implemented. DFAs for 23 TMs are listed in `tm_DNV`.

## `Decider_WFAR.v`

This decider accepts two weighted DFA (as described in [Iijil1/MITMWFAR: Testing the feasability of using weighted automatons to describe non-regular languages that solve the halting problem for some turing machines (github.com)](https://github.com/Iijil1/MITMWFAR) ) as input, and use a method similar to RepWL_ES_decider to find a set of `ExecState` which is closed under step.

The decider part, i.e. searching of the weighted DFA is not implemented. DFAs for 17 TMs are listed in `tm_WA`.
